# MelodyMeals
## Problem Description
With so many recipe options online, it can be overwhelming to find new inspiration, making the process time-consuming and sometimes frustrating. MelodyMeals simplifies this by analyzing the mood and tempo of a user’s music playlist to suggest recipes that match the playlist’s energy. This not only personalizes the cooking experience but also provides tailored inspiration that saves users from the endless scrolling typically required to find something to cook.
The primary audience includes music-loving home cooks and food enthusiasts who enjoy creating unique experiences in the kitchen. By offering recipe suggestions based on their playlist, MelodyMeals adds value by making cooking feel more dynamic, personalized, and hassle-free.

## Proposed Project
This project will use Spotify’s API due to its in-depth metadata on everything related to music, including:

• Tempo (BPM)

• Genre

• Energy level

• Mood attributes

With Spotify and a recipe API, I can gather enough data to determine a "recipe mood" and suggest recipes accordingly.

## Potential Python Modules I can use
• Spotipy: For connecting and receiving data from the Spotify API.

• Pandas: For organizing and manipulating playlist metadata and correlating it with recipe
types.

• Python's Random Module: If I want to add an element of variability to recipe
suggestions

## Output Description
The output will be a web-based application where users input a Spotify playlist link and receive a list of recipes that match the playlist's mood. The web app will display:

• Song metadata with associated “mood” and genre calculations.

• A set of recipes suggested based on the playlist’s general vibe

The web output makes sense for users who want easy interaction and a visual experience, while also allowing links to recipe sites for full instructions.

## Stretch Goals
My proposed website will be very simple, taking just one playlist as input from the user, and displaying recipe recommendations based off that playlist’s metadata. However, if time permits, I would love to expand on this application in a variety of ways:

• Experiment with multiple user inputs: Allow users to input multiple playlists and receive customized recipe suggestions for each playlist. This would cater to users who want different cooking experiences based on various playlists they have.

• Enhance recipe suggestions using multiple APIs: Integrate more recipe APIs like Edamam or Yummly to refine the matching process. This could diversify the output provided to the user, making the application more enticing.

• Recipe pairing with individual songs: instead of matching recipes to an entire playlist’s vibes, I could try to provide recipe suggestions tailored to each specific song. This would greatly increase the number of recipes given to the user, ensuring at least one entices the user.

• User accounts and favorite recipes: add accounts that allow the user to save their favorite playlists and associated recipes. This would improve user engagement by allowing them to easily revisit their favorite music-meal pairings
